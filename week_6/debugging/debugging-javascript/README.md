# Debugging Javascript - Exercise
This repo contains some code for a Debugging quiz. But currently it's broken.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the repo and install packages: `npm install`

## Running the App
Once the app is built, you can run it with `npm run start`

> Note: If you'd like to see what the `start` instruction is doing, check the `scripts` section in the `package.json`

## Instructions
1. Use the Node.JS debugger to identify problems in the code.
2. Once you've fixed the errors, run the quiz. See if you can get all of the answers right!
